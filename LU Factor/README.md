## LU Factorization
* The function luFactor determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix
* By using partial pivoting and decomposition we can find the Lower and Upper Triangular Matrices

#### Inputs:
* A = a coefficient matrix

#### Outputs: 
* L = lower triangular matrix
* U = upper triangular matrix
* P = the pivot matrix
