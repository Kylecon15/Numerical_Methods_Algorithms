## Simpsons Method
#### Inputs: 
* x = equally or unequally spaced interval vector
* y = the values of the function with respect to x
#### Outputs:
* I = the integral of the vector of function values 'y' with respect to 'x'
* Warning: If the interval is odd then the trapezoidal rule must be used on the last interval
