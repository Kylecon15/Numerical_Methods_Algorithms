### This Repository contains all the algorithms I have wrote in my numerical methods class at Colorado State University. 
#### False Position
* Locates the root of the function by using the false position formula
#### LU Factorization
* Determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix by using partial pivoting and decomposition to find the lower and upper triangular matrices
#### Prime #'s

#### Simpsons Method
