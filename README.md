# **Numerical_Methods_Algorithms**
### This Repository contains all the algorithms I have wrote in my numerical methods class at Colorado State University. 
#### *False Position*
- Locates the root of the function by using the false position formula
#### *LU Factorization*
- Determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix by using partial pivoting and decomposition to find the lower and upper triangular matrices
#### *Prime #'s*
- Determines all prime numbers between a given array
#### *Simpsons Method*
- Estimates the integral of the function by using Simpsons 1/3 rule and the trapezoidal rule
