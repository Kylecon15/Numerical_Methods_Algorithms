# Numerical_Methods_Algorithms
## This Repository contains all the algorithms I have wrote so far
### All of the algorithms are function scripts that can be used by anyone
### They are all desgined and tested in MatLab which is a matrix laboratory software

### Each algorithm will have a README.md file within them to explain what each does
