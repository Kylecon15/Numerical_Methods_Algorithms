## Prime Number Finder
* The function "prime" determines all prime numbers between m and n
* First the numbers of m and n must be checked to see if they are both positive and that n > m so that the upper bound is larger than the lower bound
* Then there are multiple loops that are used to iterate to find all of the prime numbers within the range of m and n
* Finally when the function is done iterating through m and n the ammount of prime numbers present within the iterval is displayed 
#### Inputs: 
* m - an integer
* n - an integer where n>m
#### Outputs:
* pr - a vector whose elements are the prime numbers between 1 and n
